I’m a Software Engineer focused on Data Engineering and Backend Development. I enjoy turning raw data into meaningful insights and building reliable, scalable systems. My work centers on designing solutions that address current needs while keeping future growth in mind.

I’m also exploring authentication and authorization systems and currently working on a side project in this space. If this is something that interests you too, I’d be glad to connect and exchange ideas.
